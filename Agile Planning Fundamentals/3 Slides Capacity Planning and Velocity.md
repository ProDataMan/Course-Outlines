# Section 3: Capacity Planning and Velocity


In this section, we will delve into the concepts of capacity planning and velocity in Agile project management. Capacity planning involves determining the team's available resources and the amount of work they can handle in a given time frame. Velocity measures the team's historical productivity and guides the planning process for future iterations.

# 3.1 Understanding Capacity Planning


---


# The Importance of Capacity Planning


- Avoid overloading the team
- Ensure a realistic workload
- Improve predictability


---


# 3.2 Calculating Velocity


---


# What is Velocity?


- Key metric in Agile
- Measures team's productivity
- Helps in planning future iterations


---


# Calculating Velocity


- Based on completed user stories
- Provides insights into team's historical performance


---


# 3.3 Using Velocity for Planning


---


# Estimating Work


- Velocity aids in estimating how much work can be done in a sprint
- Crucial for sprint planning


---


# Adjusting Iteration Length


- Velocity can guide decisions on iteration length
- Balancing workload and predictability

# Exercise 3: Calculating Velocity


**Exercise: Calculating Velocity**


Engage in a hands-on exercise to calculate the velocity of a fictional Agile team based on completed user stories. Apply the velocity metric to plan the scope of the next iteration, ensuring a balanced workload for the team.


---


# Objective


In this exercise, you will calculate the velocity of the Scrum Team based on completed user stories. Velocity is a key metric in Agile project management that measures the team's productivity.


---


# Scenario Setup


You are a member of the Scrum Team working on the e-commerce website project. The team has completed several user stories in previous sprints.


---


# User Story 1: Implement Social Media Authentication


...


---


# User Story 2: Product Recommendations Based on Previous Purchases


...


---


# User Story 3: Display Similar Customer Purchases


...


---


# Instructions


1. **Review Completed User Stories:** Begin by reviewing the user stories that the Scrum Team has successfully completed in the past sprints. These stories should be fully implemented and meet the definition of done.

# Instructions (Continued)


2. **Select a Sprint for Calculation:** Choose a specific sprint for which you want to calculate velocity. This sprint should have a set of completed user stories.


3. **Identify Completed User Stories:** List the user stories that were completed during the selected sprint. Make sure you have a clear record of these stories, including their respective story points or size estimates.

4. **Sum Story Points:** Add up the story points of all completed user stories in the selected sprint. This total represents the amount of work the team successfully delivered during that sprint.


5. **Calculate Velocity:** Once you have the sum of story points for completed user stories, you can calculate the velocity. Velocity is typically measured in story points per sprint. To calculate it, divide the sum of story points by the number of sprints you are considering (in this case, the selected sprint).


---


# Instructions (Continued)


Example: If the sum of story points for completed user stories in Sprint 5 is 30 and you're calculating velocity for Sprint 5, the velocity would be 30 story points per sprint.


6. **Document the Velocity:** Record the calculated velocity for the selected sprint. This will serve as a reference for future sprint planning and capacity assessment.


---


# Deliverable


Share the calculated velocity, including the sprint for which it was calculated and the methodology used. This information will be valuable for future sprint planning and capacity assessment.
