## 4.3 Planning Poker
- Planning Poker is a collaborative estimation technique.
- Team members use cards with story point values.
- Discussion and consensus-building during estimation.
- Reduces bias in estimation.
- Encourages team collaboration.


^ Planning Poker is a collaborative estimation technique where team members use cards with story point values. This approach reduces bias in estimation and fosters team collaboration through discussion and consensus-building.

## 4.4 Wideband Delphi
- Wideband Delphi is another estimation technique.
- It gathers expert opinions anonymously.
- Involves an iterative process to converge on estimates.
- Reduces biases and extremes in estimation.
- Benefits from the input of experts for accuracy.


^ Wideband Delphi is another estimation technique that gathers expert opinions anonymously and involves an iterative process to converge on estimates. This method is effective in reducing biases and extremes in estimation and benefits from the input of experts for accuracy.

## 4.5 Affinity Estimation
- Affinity Estimation simplifies estimation.
- It involves grouping user stories of similar complexity.
- Streamlines estimation for large backlogs.
- Reduces the need for detailed analysis.
- Efficient for backlog grooming.


^ Affinity Estimation simplifies the estimation process by grouping user stories of similar complexity. This approach streamlines estimation for large backlogs, reducing the need for detailed analysis and making backlog grooming more efficient.
