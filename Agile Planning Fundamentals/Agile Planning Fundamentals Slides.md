# Section 1: Iterative and Incremental Planning
## Iterative and Incremental Planning Explained
- Agile emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and value delivery in smaller increments.
- Iterative planning breaks projects into cycles for feedback and adaptation.
- Incremental planning adds functionality in stages for early progress.

::: notes
Iterative planning involves breaking down the project into smaller cycles called iterations. Each iteration produces a potentially shippable increment of the product, allowing for regular feedback and adjustment. This approach ensures that the project remains adaptable to changing requirements and stakeholder feedback.
Incremental planning focuses on delivering value in increments or stages. Each increment adds new functionality to the product. This approach enables stakeholders to see progress early and provides opportunities for adjustments based on evolving needs.
:::

## Benefits of Iterative and Incremental Planning
- Swift response to changes.
- Stakeholder feedback shapes the project.
- Reduced risk of major failures.
- Encourages continuous improvement.

::: notes
Iterative and incremental planning allows teams to respond to changes swiftly. As iterations and increments are completed, adjustments can be made based on new information and feedback. By delivering working increments early, stakeholders can experience tangible progress and provide input that shapes the project's direction. Breaking the project into smaller parts reduces the risk of major failures. Adjustments can be made before significant investments are made. The iterative and incremental approach encourages continuous improvement through regular assessments and adaptations.
:::

## Implementing Iterative and Incremental Planning
1. Define the iteration cycle.
2. Prioritize backlog items.
3. Review work with stakeholders.
4. Adapt based on feedback.

::: notes
Define the duration of each iteration and the goals to be achieved within that time frame.
Work with stakeholders to prioritize backlog items for each iteration. Focus on delivering high-priority features early.
Regularly review the work completed in each iteration with stakeholders and incorporate their feedback into the next iteration.
Use the feedback gathered to make adjustments to future iterations, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.
