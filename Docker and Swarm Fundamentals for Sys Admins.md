# Docker and Swarm Fundamentals for Sys Admins

**Course Information:**

- Title: Docker and Swarm Fundamentals for Sys Admins
- Duration: 3 days (12 sessions)
- Delivery: Live, remote, instructor-led

**Course Overview:**

This 3-day course is designed to provide sys admins with a comprehensive understanding of Docker and Swarm, two essential technologies for containerization and orchestration. Participants will learn the fundamentals of Docker, including installation, container management, and image creation. They will also explore Docker Swarm for cluster management and container orchestration. Through hands-on labs and practical exercises, participants will gain the skills needed to deploy and manage containerized applications efficiently.

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts and architecture of Docker and Swarm.
2. Install and configure Docker on various platforms.
3. Build, manage, and deploy containers using Docker.
4. Create and share Docker images effectively.
5. Explore container networking and storage management.
6. Implement container orchestration with Docker Swarm.
7. Configure and scale services in a Docker Swarm cluster.
8. Implement high availability and fault tolerance in Swarm.
9. Monitor and troubleshoot Docker and Swarm deployments.

**Prerequisites:**

Participants should have a basic understanding of Linux command-line interface and system administration concepts. Familiarity with virtualization technologies and networking principles is recommended.
