# Test Automation with Selenium

Course Duration: 2 Days

Course Description:
The Test Automation with Selenium course is a comprehensive 2-day workshop that focuses on equipping participants with the skills to automate software testing using Selenium, an industry-standard open-source tool for automating web applications. Through hands-on labs and practical exercises, participants will learn how to create effective test plans, develop automated tests, and identify and fix errors in a web application hosted on GitHub. The course progressively introduces more advanced techniques in Selenium to enhance the coverage and efficiency of test automation.
