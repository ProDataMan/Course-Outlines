# Behavior Driven Development

**Description:**
The Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) training seminar is a 4-day comprehensive program that empowers software projects to succeed by implementing collaboration, communication techniques, and concrete requirements that can be translated into automated tests. BDD ensures alignment and agreement on project goals and objectives among all stakeholders, from developers to non-technical personnel. The course covers communication skills, collaborative practices, and automation tools to seamlessly integrate BDD into large-scale and enterprise development practices, including Agile and DevOps.

**Learning Objectives:**
Upon completion of this course, participants will learn how to:
- Implement and improve BDD practices
- Prioritize features based on business goals
- Facilitate example mapping sessions
- Write automated acceptance tests
- Scale up automated acceptance tests
- Deliver accurate reporting and documentation
- Improve teamwork, dynamics, and collaboration with stakeholders
- Discover and analyze requirements, uncover assumptions, and reduce risks
- Enhance the effectiveness of acceptance, integration, and unit testing
- Automate reporting and living documentation to improve transparency

**Target Audience:**
This course is suitable for all development teams and does not require prior experience with BDD. Examples in the course are demonstrated using Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
